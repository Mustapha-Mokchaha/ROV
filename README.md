# ROV
This project presents a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) designed for underwater inspection of oil and gas pipelines. Equipped with a webcam and powered by computer vision and deep learning (YOLO), the ROV can detect cracks and leaks in real time. The system aims to support sustainable infrastructure monitoring in alignment with SDGs 9, 13, and 14.
